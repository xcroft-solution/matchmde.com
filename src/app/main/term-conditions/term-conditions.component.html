            <ul>
                <li>The service is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting the foregoing, the
                    company expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the

                    purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. Without limiting the foregoing, the company
                    makes no warranty or representation that access to or operation of the service will be uninterrupted
                    or error free. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading
                    and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the service. Some
                    jurisdictions limit or do not permit disclaimers of warranty, so this provision may not apply to
                    you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>14. LIMITATION OF DAMAGES; RELEASE</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the company, its affiliates, directors,
                    or employees, or its licensors or partners, be liable to you for any loss of profits, use, or data,
                    or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that
                    result from (a) the use, disclosure, or display of your user content; (b) your use or inability to
                    use the service; (c) the service generally or the software or systems that make the service
                    available; or (d) any other interactions with the company or any other user of the service, whether
                    based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, and whether or
                    not the company has been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth
                    herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions limit or do not permit
                    disclaimers of liability, so this provision may not apply to you.</li>
                <li>If you have a dispute with one or more users or a merchant of a product or service that you review
                    using the Service, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures
                    and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature,
                    known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</li>
            </ul>
